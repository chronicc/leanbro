![fistbump with the word LEAN on it](images/icon128.png)

the most lean browser startpage. it's not an ass - it's your bro.

## Motivation

Existing browser startpage extensions are just nuts with all their advertising, registration and offering bullshit. I just need a goddamn browser startpage which provides the most useful information and don't try to imitate features the browser already offers. What is most important is that the extension does not try to break my flow when working with my browser.

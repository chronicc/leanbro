![fistbump with the word LEAN on it](src/images/icon128.png)

the leanest browser startpage. it's not an ass - it's your bro.

## Motivation

Existing browser startpage extensions are just nuts with all their advertising, registration and offerings. I need a very lean browser startpage which only provides the most useful information and don't try to imitate features the browser already offers. What is most important is that the extension does not try to break my flow when working inside my browser. The presented information need to be recognizable and memorizable within a few seconds so I don't reside on the startpage. Also a nice background image to sparkle creativity and induce a feeling of calm.

leanbro does not disturb you. It supports you by reaching and staying in [the zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).
